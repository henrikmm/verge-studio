# Tasks — what to do next

Only unfinished work lives here. What already works and why is in [REGISTRY.md](REGISTRY.md); how
to work in this repository is in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

**When a task is done, delete it from this file and write what it established into the Registry,
in the same change.** Git history is the archive. Never keep a finished task here as a record.

Every task is owned by the agent. None of them is a request for the user to go and do something,
even when a step needs the user's hands or their permission.

## How a task is written

A task is a test with a plan attached. It states the pass condition **before** the work starts, so
finishing is a fact rather than an opinion. Five fields, then the steps:

- **Why** — the reason this task exists. What is wrong today, what it costs us, what breaks if we
  skip it. This is the most important field: a task whose Why is thin is a task nobody should
  start.
- **Gate** — the condition that decides whether the work succeeded. Written so it can be run,
  with the numbers it has to beat.
- **Regression** — what must not get worse. Nearly every change here can improve one number while
  quietly ruining another, so name the thing being protected and where to check it.
- **Approval** — `none`, `user confirmation`, or `cloud spend + user confirmation`. Where you stop
  and ask. It is not permission to leave the task half done.
- **Start** — the files and commands to read first.

Then a checklist of steps. Tick a box when that step is done and verified, not when the code is
written. Unticked boxes are allowed in this file and nowhere else in the repository.

### 2. Let the app say "I cannot find the ground"

**Why.** When the evidence for a floor is weak, the app picks a winner anyway and draws it exactly
like a good one. A thin fit and a solid fit are indistinguishable on screen, so the operator has
no way to know which they are looking at. Refusing is a real answer and the app cannot give it.

**Gate.** A fit the evidence does not support is reported as a refusal that downstream steps
respect — a measurement resting on an untrusted floor refuses too, rather than quoting a number.
The thresholds come from measured cases, not from taste, and the user has agreed the wording.

**Regression.** The door fixture at 504 px must still produce a floor. A rule strict enough to
refuse the one scene we have tape truth for is too strict, whatever it does for the others.

**Approval.** `user confirmation`, for the final wording and behaviour of the warning.

**Start.** `geometry/plane.ts` returns every hypothesis it scored; `inspect floor` reports the gap
between the best two. REGISTRY section 3 has four measured cases. The display half already exists
(`app/src/panes/floor-state.ts`).

- [ ] **Do not use `separation` as the signal.** It measured something real when the two proposal
      pools disagreed; now that they find the same plane it reads ~0.000 on a good fit, so a low
      separation means agreement rather than a coin flip. Its meaning inverted on 2026-08-08.
- [ ] Set the thresholds from the measured cases. Two known cases where the app returns junk and
      calls it a floor: the 6.2%-support fit (door fixture at `inlierDistance 0.1, maxTiltDeg 45,
      stride 32, iterations 250`), and the confidence-veto case in `plane.test.ts`, where the app's
      own gates return a plane with 1.12% support. `minInlierFraction` is 0.01 and sits just below
      it. `belowFraction` is the cleaner discriminator: good fits now read 0.00–0.89%, the junk
      reads 7.66–14.87%.
- [ ] `room-252px-256f` is the one reconstruction the reproducibility fix did not rescue — 35.7 cm
      of seed spread with 1.3–2.7% support. It is the natural first case to refuse.
- [ ] Make refusal travel: a height measured against a refused floor must refuse as well.
- [ ] Agree the wording with the user before it ships.

### 7. Watch a real cold start, once

**Why.** The 2026-08-11 hardware session exercised every phase of a run except one. `waking` never
appeared, because connecting to the service had already woken the container, so by the time Run was
pressed the instance was up and the readout went straight to loading the model. That phase is the
longest a cold run has — 64 s measured — and the only thing that has ever exercised it is the
mock's rehearsal against a synthetic 503.

**Gate.** One run whose first request is the thing that wakes the instance, with `waking` visible
in the readout and its elapsed clock running while `/gpu` is not answering. The measured duration
goes in the Registry beside the 64 s already quoted.

**Regression.** None to the run path; this is an observation of it.

**Approval.** `cloud spend + user confirmation`. Batch it with whatever else needs the GPU — do
not pay for a startup to watch a startup.

**Start.** `lib/run-phase.ts` `applyGpu`; REGISTRY section 3 "The run is visible now".

- [ ] Deploy, then press Run **without** connecting first, so the inference request is the one
      that wakes the instance.
- [ ] Record the real cold-start duration against the quoted 64 s.

### 8. Verify the 3D orbit by hand

**Why.** The 2026-08-11 design review could not confirm acceptance item 5. The point cloud renders
and the axis gizmo is visible, but two automated `left_click_drag` passes over the canvas produced
no camera change and the first selected page text instead. Nothing in that session touched orbit, so
this is a gap in the check rather than a known regression — and an unverified checklist item is
exactly the kind of tick AGENTS.md says has cost this project money twice.

**Gate.** A drag inside Viewport 3D visibly changes the view, confirmed by comparing two captures.
Either the automation is made to work, or the human-gateway protocol is used and the result recorded.

**Regression.** None — this is a check, not a change.

**Approval.** `none` to investigate; `user confirmation` only if it needs their hand on the mouse.

**Start.** `app/src/panes/viewport-3d.tsx` pointer handling; the 2026-08-11 entry in
`docs/design-review-log.md` has what was tried.

- [ ] Find out whether the drag fails because of the automation or the pane.
- [ ] If it is the pane, that is a real defect and this task becomes a fix.

### 4. Decide what measuring grass means, then build it

**Why.** Vegetation is the goal this project is aimed at, and we cannot currently measure it. A
plant is not a door repeated many times: it has no single height to be right or wrong about, so
the question has to be redefined before any code is written.

**Gate.** The definition and the physical reference protocol are agreed with the user first. Then
the raster is built and checked against a real reference, reporting its error, how much of the
area had enough evidence, and how often it abstained.

**Regression.** The existing object measurement path must keep working. This adds a second way to
measure, and must not disturb the one that is already graded against tape.

**Approval.** `user confirmation` of what is being measured and how it will be checked, before any
code. This is a definition problem before it is an engineering one.

**Start.** `donor/` has a worked version of the cell-and-percentile approach and is the template.
The outdoor clip on disk (`20260806-193346-26d16e`) is useful scene evidence, but its current
1.150 m truth belongs to a large tree-like endpoint target. It is not grass truth and must not be
relabelled as one.

- [ ] Agree with the user what number we are claiming and how a person could check it.
- [ ] Lay a grid on the local ground; take a robust height statistic per cell.
- [ ] Gate each cell on coverage and confidence, and abstain where the evidence is thin. Do not
      try to find individual plants.
- [ ] Output a heat map, not a list of objects.
- [ ] Check it against the physical reference and report error, coverage and abstention rate.

### 6. Give the side column a floor, so 20% cannot squeeze its own tabs out

**Why.** The window is split 40/40/20 as of 2026-08-09, and 20% is a share rather than a size. At
1280 px it is 256 px, which Dockview cannot fit three tabs into — Runs moves behind an overflow
chevron, one click deeper than it was at 427 px. Below about 1100 px the Objects target names
truncate to `D…` and `Ta…`, so the list stops naming what it lists. Nobody chose either; they are
what a pure percentage does at the small end.

**Gate.** At 1024×800 the Inspector group shows all three tabs with no overflow chevron, and every
target name in Objects renders without an ellipsis. At 1600×900 and above the split is still
40/40/20 to within a pixel — a minimum must not become the layout on a wide screen.

**Regression.** Depth 2D and Viewport 3D stay equal to each other at every width. A minimum that
takes from one viewer and not the other trades a squeezed panel for a lopsided window, which is
the asymmetry this split was introduced to remove.

**Approval.** `user confirmation`, for the minimum width itself. 280 px is a guess from the two
measured failures above, not a measurement.

**Start.** `applyDefaultSplit` and `SIDE_PANEL_SHARE` in `app/src/lib/dock-store.ts`; the
2026-08-09 entry in `docs/design-review-log.md` has the measurements.

- [ ] Find the width at which the three tabs stop fitting, by measuring rather than guessing.
- [ ] Clamp the side column to that, taking the difference from both viewers equally.
- [ ] Confirm the clamp is inactive at 1280 px and above, so the asked-for 40/40/20 is what a
      normal window gets.
